   Kajiki 0.9 will require Python 3.4+.

0.8.2 (2019-11-26)
------------------

* Fixed some HTML entities not being properly recognised

0.8.1 (2019-10-20)
------------------

* Fixed unexpected <DOCTYPE> when including templates

0.8.0 (2019-06-03)
------------------

0.7.1 (2017-09-11)
------------------

* Allow to replace ``gettext`` function by providing it in the template context or through ``base_globals`` in Loader

0.7.0 (2017-06-27)
------------------

* Text for i18n is now extracted ignoring the empty spaces surrounding the text itself. Empty text will always be treated as non translatable nodes for performance reasons.
* ``extract_python`` option will now report syntax errors when extracting text for translation.

0.6.3 (2017-05-25)
------------------

* Added ``extract_python`` option to babel message extractor, this allows extracting gettext calls in ``${}`` expressions

0.6.1 (2016-11-28)
------------------

* Actually report 0.6 in kajiki/version.py
* Expose ``strip_text`` option in loader

0.6.0 (2016-11-27)
------------------

* Fixed ``py:switch`` error message wrongly mentioning ``py:with``
* Support for multiline ``${}`` expressions
* Subsequent text nodes are now squashed into a single text node. This allows translating whole paragraphs instead of single sentences.
* Allow code and function calls inside tag attributes
* Added ``strip_text`` option to XMLTemplate and i18n collector to ensure leading and trailing spaces are stipped by text nodes (also leads to minified HTML)
* Some HTML nodes that do not require being closed but is commonly considered best practice to close them are now emitted with ending tag (IE: <p>)
* Generally improved code documentation to lower entry barrier for contributors


0.5.5 (2016-06-08)
------------------

* ``py:attrs`` will now emit the attribute name itself or will omit the attribute at all in case of
  ``bool`` values for 'checked', 'disabled', 'readonly', 'multiple', 'selected', 'nohref',
  'ismap', 'declare' and 'defer',

0.5.4 (2016-06-04)
------------------

* ``py:switch`` now correctly supports multiple ``py:case`` statements.
* text inside ``<script>`` and ``<style>`` tags is no longer collected translation.
* Syntax errors now report the line and the surrounding code when there is a markup or python syntax error.
* As ``py:swtich`` discards all its content apart from ``py:case`` and ``py:else`` statements it will now correctly report an error when the statements has other content.
* ``py:else`` will now correctly detect spurious content between itself and ``py:if`` as the two must be consequential.
* Improved code documentation on core classes.

0.5.3 (2016-01-25)
------------------

* ``py:with`` statement now keeps order of variables, so that variables can depend from each other.
* Babel is no longer a dependency unless you want to use the message extractor.

0.5.2 (2015-10-13)
------------------

* TranslatableTextNodes are now only generated for non-empty strings
